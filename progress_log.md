# Progress Log

### Fri, Sept 26, 2025
- Continued the project of integrating a web scraper with an AI model. This session focused on finalizing the logic of
  the data scraper, configuring environment variables, cleaning up some warnings, and create skeleton code for the SDK configuration.
- Updating the README.md on the mini project
- Moving the portofolio to different repository
- Todo: AI prompt builder, which consist of -> Setting up SDK Project, Exploring Prompt Tuning, Exploring Model Content Generation Config Tuning

### Thu, Sept 25, 2025
- Continued the project of integrating a web scraper with an AI model. This session focused on learning Python module management and implementing best practices for clean code. The primary goal was to refactor the existing codebase into a more modular structure, which is easier to maintain, and to set up some running configuration documentation.
- Todo: AI prompt builder, finalize the filter for scraped data

### Mon, Sept 22, 2025

- Continued the fun project of integrating a web scraper with AI model, learnt how to scrape data from a website's
  network traffic. This session focused more on learning Python and data scraping. The AI model configuration will be
  set up once we have the scraped data from the target website (on this project is spotify).
- Todo: AI prompt builder, setup AI model on google vertex, refactor the project file if it get more than 500 lines (
  split it to specific domain of implementation, example: data-scraping logic and ai sdk configuration is separated)

### Fri, Sept 19, 2025

- Over the last two weeks, I've occasionally delved into basic of Python and have now started a new mini-project focused
  on web scraping and AI integration. I apologize for the lack of updates on my learning sessions here; I've been
  dealing with a recent health relapse and some family bereavement events.
- I've also been reading "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann in my spare time. I haven't
  finished it, but I've noticed that I've already implemented some of the material in my previous employment. For anyone
  who manages large-scale, data-intensive web applications that require high reliability and performance, I definitely
  recommend this
  book. [Here is a link to get the book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XPJML5D?ref=knfdg_R_pape_pew)

### Sat, August 30, 2025

- Getting back to re-learning Python (from the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes), after I had to support my
  family during a tough time and a period of bereavement. Some of my family members were hospitalized, and one of them
  passed away last week. Hopefully, I can get back on track while still grieving and helping my family by part-time
  caretaking for the kids (my nephews and nieces) and the sick family member. (edited for clarity 19092025 - the grammar
  on previous update was a bit scrambled)

### Fri, August 8, 2025

- Uploading study plan structure to GitHub

  lesson: [Introduction to Gen AI](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/118?utm_source=cgc&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=evergreen)
  and write summary of learning

### Thu, August 7, 2025
