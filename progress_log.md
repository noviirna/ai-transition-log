# Progress Log

### Sat, August 30, 2025
- Get back to re-learning python square (from book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes), after I had to support my family during tough times and bereavement period.
Some of my family member hospitalized, and one of them ended up passed away last week.
Hopefully I can get back again on track while still grieving and helping my family by part-time caretaking the kids (my nephews and nieces) and the sick family member.
