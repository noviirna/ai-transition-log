|[spotify-playlist-dating-redflag-analysis](https://github.com/noviirna/spotify-playlist-dating-redflag-analysis)|Data Scraping, Python, Selenium, Google AI SDK, Gen AI| 19th Sept 2025| What do your playlists say about you? This Python app uses web scraping and Gen AI to reveal your music-based "dating red flags" for entertainment. This project represents the successful MVP (Minimum Viable Product) build, which was executed in seven days of focused part-time work to quickly demonstrate core technical proficiency in Python.
The MVP's main objective was to validate a solid, production-ready data pipeline by:
- Custom Data Acquisition: Extracting dynamic song metadata from a public Spotify playlist using network traffic interception (demonstrating dynamic scraping proficiency).
- Structured AI Integration: Leveraging the Google Vertex AI API SDK for reliable, structured text generation based on dynamic input.
- Pipeline Engineering: Implementing a complete data flow from unformatted scrape data to final, formatted output.|
